      <br>
      <p>
        Eris is one of the most massive known dwarf planets, with a bright, icy surface
        covered in frozen methane. When Eris is far from the Sun, its atmosphere collapses
        and freezes onto the ground. As it moves closer, the frost may turn back into a thin gas.
        Its highly reflective surface makes it one of the brightest objects in the Kuiper Belt.

      <h2 class="mission-title">Past & Current Missions</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.7;">
        No spacecraft has visited Eris yet. Most of what we know comes from telescopic
        observations and the study of its moon Dysnomia, which helped scientists calculate
        its mass and density.

      <h2 class="mission-title">Upcoming Missions</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 2.1;">
        Future mission concepts propose sending orbiters or flyby spacecraft to explore
        dwarf planets like Eris, Makemake, and Haumea. These missions aim to study their
        surfaces, atmospheres, and origins to better understand the outer Solar System.

  <h1 class="section-title">Weird Facts</h1>

  <ul class="text3">
    <li>Eris is slightly smaller in size than Pluto but more massive.</li>
    <li>Its discovery in 2005 led to Pluto being reclassified as a dwarf planet.</li>
    <li>Eris reflects about 96% of the sunlight that hits it—almost as reflective as fresh snow.</li>
    <li>Its orbit is highly elongated and tilted 44° from the Solar System’s plane.</li>
    <li>When far from the Sun, its atmosphere freezes onto the surface.</li>
    <li>Dysnomia, its moon, is named after the spirit of lawlessness.</li>
    <li>Eris takes more than half a millennium to complete one orbit around the Sun.</li>
